###MEAN Stack Application

SuggestU is a mean stack application that finds the perfect items for your shopping cart. The app has been developed for easy further implementation of more API's. Now, SuggestU is only compatible with Walmarts API, but I plan on including Etsy, Amazon, and more. 

##How to Use

The user will scroll through products and "like" or bookmark items. Next, the user can take advantage of the side bars suggestion generator that will favor categories based on their bookmarks.


##To View

Visit https://polar-shelf-78066.herokuapp.com/ to view and sign up, or simply visit https://github.com/troycarson100/project4 to view the repository.

##Development process

Technologies used: MongoDB | ExpressJS | AngularJS | NodeJS

Using third party API calls to Walmart, I could populate my front-end search for the user. Then, the user is able to store products they like and have them saved to their private database.


##Not-Yet-Implemented
 * Include calls to more API's such as Etsy and amazon for variety.
 * Make suggestions less specific. Include more than just the top category.
 
##User Stories
 
 As a user, I enjoy SuggestU's suggestion picker. It helps find me random things I wouldnt have before considered looking at. 
 
 As a user, I like SuggestU's option to remove items coming from a specific website.
